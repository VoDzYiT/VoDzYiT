# **What youâ€™ll find here**
Here I upload different projects â€” usually from university or personal learning.
Right now I have two main repositories:

[Resolution method project](https://github.com/VoDzYiT/ResolutionMethod)
A project where I implemented the resolution method from logic programming using Python.

[Machine learning course](https://github.com/VoDzYiT/machine-learning-course)
This repo includes my practical work while exploring basic ML topics.

### **Tools**
In these repositories, I mostly used:  
- **Python** (my main language)  
- Various libraries such as **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, **Matplotlib**, and **TensorFlow**
