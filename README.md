Here I upload different projects â€” usually from university or personal learning.
Right now I have two main repositories:

A project where I explore customer behavior, sales trends, retention, cohort analysis, segmentation, and more using e-commerce data

[Resolution method project](https://github.com/VoDzYiT/ResolutionMethod)
A project where I implemented the resolution method from logic programming using Python.

[Machine learning course](https://github.com/VoDzYiT/machine-learning-course)
This repo includes my practical work while exploring basic ML topics.
